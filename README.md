# DSCI Project: Analyzing Health Insurance Rates
For my Data Science 351: Foundations of Data Management class, I had to  develop an interface to allows user to explore, search, and analyze
the data in a database of our choosing. I decided to use Health Insurance Marketplace dataset from Kaggle. 

The 4 basic functions of the interface was to:
  - Be able to explore key variables
  - Be able to search the database
  - Report basic analytics about the dataset
  - Visualize the dataset
  
  Users can play around with widgets to accomplish all the functions stated above.
